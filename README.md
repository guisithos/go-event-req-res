# Event-Driven Go Web Application

This project is a Go-based web application that demonstrates an event-driven architecture using RabbitMQ as a message broker and Oracle as the database.

## Features
- Web interface for user input and data display
- Event-driven architecture for handling user actions
- Integration with RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing
- Oracle database for data storage

## Tech Stack
- Go (Golang) for backend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend
- RabbitMQ for message queuing
- Oracle Database for data persistence
- Docker for containerization

## Setup
1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the application

## Usage
Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`. Use the navigation to access different tasks and interact with the application.

## Note
This project is a demonstration and may require additional configuration for production use.
